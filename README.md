# FUTRO

FUTRO is an all-in-one digital ecosystem built for students of the Federal University of Technology Owerri (FUTO).

It combines shopping, errands, campus deliveries, and student-powered commerce into one seamless digital experience.

FUTRO — “We go to the market so.. you can focus on what truly matters: your studies and your goals.” 🏃‍♀️💨

## The Problem
Every FUTO student knows the struggle:
Long queues, tight lecture schedules, and limited time to go to the market or buy essentials.

Because of this, students end up eating and feeding on junks, simply due to lack of time to go to the market and buy what they need.
There’s no reliable, student-friendly system to handle their errands or shopping conveniently — until now.
